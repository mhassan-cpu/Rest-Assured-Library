# Library REST API Automation Project

![Library System](Download.png)

This project demonstrates a comprehensive testing framework for a RESTful API that supports Books, Households, Users, and Wishlists. The system has been automated using both **Postman** and **Rest-Assured** frameworks, with rich reporting and continuous integration support.

## ðŸ§ª Project Testing Strategy

The API automation includes:

- **Postman Collections** with test scripts
- **Rest-Assured TestNG test cases** covering:
  - Positive and Negative scenarios
  - Validation of response time, status codes, headers, data types, and formats
- **JSON Schema validation** (where applicable)
- **Soft Assertions** for grouped validations

---

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Integration

Jenkins is used for continuous integration. Two approaches are supported:

1. **Freestyle Project**  
   - Batch command to navigate and run Maven:
     ```cmd
     cd /d "D:\Training\Library"
     mvn clean verify -Denv="http://localhost:3000"
     ```

2. **Git Pipeline (Declarative)**  
   Example stage from `Jenkinsfile`:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
     agent any
     stages {
       stage('Get Code') {
         steps {
           git url: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
         }
       }
       stage('Run Tests') {
         steps {
           bat '''cd /d D:\\Training\\Library && mvn clean verify -Denv="http://localhost:3000"'''
         }
       }
     }
   }
